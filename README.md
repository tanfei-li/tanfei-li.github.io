# Personal Summary

I am currently completing the last semester of my Master's degree in Economics from Sciences Po Paris School of Research. My thesis investigates the impact of preferential housing benefits for public sector works on their wealth accumulation trajectory in China after housing market privitisation in the 1990s. 
I have research skills in literature review and web crawling, regression analysis in R and Stata, and model simulation in Julia.
I am actively looking for research opportunities in wealth and taxation, development, and energy transition, where I can deepen my skills in econometrics and data analytics.
